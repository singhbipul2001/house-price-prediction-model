    "# **House Price** Prediction Using Tensor Flow Decision Forest \n",
    "This notebook walks you through how to train a baseline Random Forest model using TensorFlow Decision Forests on the House Prices dataset made available for this competition.\n",

    "```\n",
    "import tensorflow_decision_forests as tfdf\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "dataset = pd.read_csv(\"project/dataset.csv\")\n",

    "Decision Forests are a family of tree-based models including Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees. They are the best place to start when working with tabular data, and will often outperform (or provide a strong baseline) before you begin experimenting with neural networks."
