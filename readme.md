# **🏡 House Price Prediction \- Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle)**

## **🎯 Project Overview**

This project is a solution attempt for the Kaggle "House Prices \- Advanced Regression Techniques" competition. The goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the final sale price (SalePrice) of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

The dataset is notable for its complexity, providing **79 explanatory variables** that describe nearly every aspect of the homes, requiring significant effort in data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection.

## **📊 Dataset and Features**

The dataset, originally compiled by Dean De Cock (Ames Housing dataset), serves as a modern alternative to the classic Boston Housing dataset.

| Detail | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Location** | Ames, Iowa, USA |
| **Target Variable** | SalePrice (The final sale price of the house) |
| **Feature Count** | 79 explanatory variables (qualitative and quantitative) |
| **Key Challenges** | Handling missing data, high-dimensional categorical features, and non-linear relationships. |

## **⚙️ Project Goal and Evaluation**

### **Goal**

The primary objective is to predict the continuous numerical value of the SalePrice for each house in the provided test set.

### **Evaluation Metric (Metric)**

Submissions are evaluated based on the **Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)** between the **logarithm of the predicted price** and the **logarithm of the observed sales price**.

Taking the logarithm ensures that errors in predicting very expensive houses and very cheap houses affect the final score equally, preventing the model from being overly biased towards large absolute errors in high-priced homes.

## **🛠️ Techniques and Focus Areas**

This competition is designed to practice and apply advanced data science skills. Key areas of focus in this project include:

1. **Creative Feature Engineering:** Extracting meaningful new features from the existing 79 variables (e.g., combining related features, creating interaction terms, or applying polynomial features).  
2. **Handling Categorical Data:** Advanced encoding techniques (One-Hot, Target Encoding, etc.) for high-cardinality nominal and ordinal variables.  
3. **Advanced Regression Models:** Utilizing sophisticated algorithms that handle complex, non-linear data structures effectively:  
   * Random Forest  
   * Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) / **XGBoost** / LightGBM  
   * Regularized Linear Models (LASSO, Ridge, ElasticNet)  
4. **Ensemble Modeling:** Combining the predictions of multiple diverse models (e.g., Stacking or Averaging) to minimize generalization error and improve the final score.
